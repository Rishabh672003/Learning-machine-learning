# Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a vast field with numerous types and subtypes. Here's a list of the main types along with their
subtypes:

1. **Supervised Learning**: This is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model
   learns from the data and then uses this knowledge to predict the output for new, unseen data. Examples of supervised
   learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector
   Machines.

   1. **Regression**: Regression is a statistical method used to determine the relationship between one dependent variable
      and a series of other variables, attempting to understand the strength and character of this relationship

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to identify
   patterns and relationships within the data. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include K-Means Clustering,
   Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Apriori.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: This is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by
   performing certain actions and observing the results/rewards/results. Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are examples
   of reinforcement learning algorithms.

4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: This is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. The model is trained using both
   labeled and unlabeled data. Examples of semi-supervised learning algorithms include Label Propagation, Label Spreading,
   and Graph-based methods.
