# Roadmap to follow

1. Learn basic Python

   - All the basics like if-else and shit
   - Till list comprehension and OOPS.

2. Learn Basic Maths

   - till Basic Calculus, Probability theory, Statistics and Linear Algebra.
   - (Optional) do the [`Mathematics for Machine Learning`](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/ds4420sp20/readings/mml-book.pdf) book

3. Learn Basic ML developer Stack

   - Learn Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

4. Learn ML

   1. First do Andrew Ng's [`Machine Learning Specialization`](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses)
      Course, do a framework like Pytorch, Sci-kit learn or Tensorflow.
   2. (optional for deeper intuition on ANN) Do [`Neural Network playlist by @3blue1brown`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
   3. (optional) Do [Machine Learning from Scratch - Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2Upcrywf-u2etjdxxkL8nl7E)
   4. Do Andre Karpathy's [`Neural Networks: Zero to Hero`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
   5. Do Andrew Ng's [`Deep Learning Specialization`](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?irgwc=1#courses) course.
   6. Than do [`Hugging Face' NLP course`](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1), if you are interested in
      NLP. or Any other Specific ML course you are interested in
   7. Learn data scraping as Data is the real gold these days, links - [`Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k&pp=ygUXY29yZXkgc2NoYWZlciBiZWF1dGlmdWw%3D)

5. Start Practicing/Implementing and do real projects
   - Do this [`Intro to machine learning by Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
   - Do this [`Intermediate machine learning by Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
   - Do Kaggle challenges
   - Read research Papers, and try to Implement the paper and Re-create the results of the paper.
